# MSU DAI
These are materials developed during and for the MSU Digital Archaeology Institute. The files named 'ieldran' are from the project of the same name that can be found here: <a href="ieldran.matrix.msu.edu">ieldran- early medieval cemetery mapping project</a>. You can compare the differences in CSV and GeoJSON, see how the different files are formatted with the same data but different types of files.
